# Hi there ✌️
<p align="center">

My name is Nilton and I'm from Brazil but I'm currently living in Spain. 

I'm studying to be a full-stack developer and I'm focusing on learn Java for Back End and React for Front End web apps. 🎓

:point_right: I love to learn and study by myself and also collaborate with other people to share knowledge. 🤝
